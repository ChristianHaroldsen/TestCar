#Next Up:

Add a function to ignore inputs less than 500ms apart. Make the Up/Down/Left/Right functions dependent on a boolean from this function.

Percentages don't seem to be working: update the code to 0-255 instead of a percent to make it simpler. Did you name a global variable again?

Is state 8 not going to states 7 or 9? Or is it just the wheels aren't slowing down as expected? May need to reduce it to 25% or less.
